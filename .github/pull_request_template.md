## Pull Request Reviewer 1 {Name} Checklist 
> - [ ] #3
> - [ ] Does the code work? Does it perform its intended function, the logic is correct etc.
> - [ ] Is all the code easily understood?
> - [ ] Does it have correct linting?
> - [ ] Is there any redundant or duplicate code?
> - [ ] Is the code as modular as possible?
> - [ ] Can any global variables be replaced?
> - [ ] Can any of the code be replaced with library functions?
> - [ ] Can any logging or debugging code be removed?
> - [ ] Does code follow defined architecture?
> - [ ] Does feature implementation follow UAC and specified design?
> - [ ] Ensure PR passes CI server, re-running once or twice if it fails. Failure could be due to other issues, so determine whether the PR is responsible if failure occurs.
> - [ ] Request changes to the code and/or additional unit tests if any issues are found.
> - [ ] Is any code invoking memory leaks?
> - [ ] Are properties declared with the correct storage semantics? (e.g. weak or unowned instead of strong)
> - [ ] Are good names used for classes, Enum, struct, methods, and variables?
> - [ ] Is any edge-case handling described?
> - [ ] Is the use and function of third-party libraries documented?
> - [ ] Are data structures and units of measurement explained?
> - [ ] Is the code testable? i.e. do not add too many or hide dependencies, unable to initialize objects, test frameworks can use methods etc.
> - [ ] Do tests exist and are they comprehensive? i.e. has at least your agreed on code coverage.
> - [ ] Do unit tests actually test that the code is performing the intended functionality?
> - [ ] Are arrays checked for ‘out-of-bound’ errors?
> - [ ] Could any test code be replaced with the use of an existing API?
> - [ ] If using any 3rd party library, check for licenses and compliances.
> - [ ] If storing any sensitive information, it must be stored at secure place with encryption technique like HASH STRETCHING or something else.
